Muscle Parameter Optimization Toolbox
=============================

Overview
-------------

Estimation of optimal fiber length and tendon slack length in Hill-type muscle models included in musculoskeletal models can be challenging. This project presents an optimization based technique to adjust muscle parameters of models linearly scaled from a generic one and to obtain reasonable estimation of optimal fiber lengths and tendon slack lengths in models generated from medical images.

This project provides an OpenSim plugin and equivalent Matlab tools for estimating optimal fiber lengths and tendon slack lengths via an optimization procedure in subject specific models.
