MatLab toolbox
##############

The MatLab Muscle Parameter Optimization Toolbox can be downloaded as part of the `Muscle Optimizer repository
on GitHub <http://github.com/MuscleOptimizer/MuscleOptimizer>`_(TODO: should also provide released package?), in the ``matlab`` directory.

To use the toolbox, you should add the folder ``MuscleParOptTool`` (inside the ``matlab`` directory) to the MatLab path (see Matlab documentation - TODO add link)

The toolbox provides the ``optimMuscleParams`` function, that can be called as in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: ../../test/Example1/run_example1.m
   :language: matlab
   :start-after: % clear;clc;close all
   :encoding: latin-1
