OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Estimation of optimal fiber length and tendon slack length in Hill-type muscle models included in musculoskeletal models can be challenging. \
    This plugin provides an optimization based technique to adjust muscle parameters of models linearly scaled from a generic one and to obtain reasonable estimation of optimal fiber lengths and tendon slack lengths in models generated from medical images.\n\n\
    If you use the MuscleOptimizer plugin, we ask that you acknowledge our work where appropriate, by citing the following paper:\n\nModenese L, Ceseracciu E, Reggiani M, Lloyd DG (2015). \
